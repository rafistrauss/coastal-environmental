				Coastal Environmental Corp. is licensed by NYS to utilize X-RAY Fluorescence Equipment for lead testing and reporting. Inspectors are certified by the Environmental Protection Agency after having undergone approved certification courses and testing, as well as extensive field training in accordance with EPA/HUD standards, which is the accepted method and protocol utilized when dealing with lead based paint.  All reported results are accepted by HUD, NYS Department of Health and the Environmental Protection agency.

				<div id="titleXText" class="textDisplay">
					<p>
						Title X, the EPA /HUD disclosure regulations law, requires that all pre-1978 dwellings are subject to certain disclosure rules regarding the presence of lead based paint prior to their sale or rental. For owners of four or more unit residential properties the law went into effect on September 6, 1996,and  for one to three units on December 6,1996.  Some States have pre-empted the laws and made the Federal law stricter.
					</p>

					<p>
						Local Law 1-NYS requires that all painted surfaces within buildings built prior to 1960 be presumed to contain lead paint. Approved testing methods can rebut the presumption. In addition, when painted surfaces are disturbed, special precautions must be taken - wipe samples of the surface must be collected and analyzed to insure compliance with the laws standard of acceptance.  Local law 1 of 2004 broadens owner responsibilities in dealing with renovations, refinancing and day to day operations of multifamily residential housing. Local law 1 of 2004 is a comprehensive law concerning the prevention of childhood lead poisoning through the remediation of lead paint hazards in housing and day care facilities. This law repeals the former lead law, local #38 of 1999. The law covers all pre 1960 multi family dwellings. The law also places certain responsibilities on owners of post 1960 to pre 1978 buildings where the owner knows there is lead based paint.
					</p>

					<p>
						Condominiums and Cooperatives-  Local Law 1 does not apply where title to a dwelling is held by a cooperative of condominium and the owner of record or his family resides in the unit. It does however apply if the unit is rented out.

				<div id="healthText" class="textDisplay">
					<p>
						In 1991 the Secretary of HUD characterized Lead poisoning as the” number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States”. The presence of lead based paint in housing represents the most significant hazard remaining for lead poisoning, particularly for young children. The most common means of exposure is for young children to eat peeled and flaked pieces of paint, to chew on chewable surfaces such as window sills and eating or inhaling lead based paint dust, resulting in brain damage, neurological and kidney damage, delayed growth and hyperactivity or lethargy. Exposure for adults can be equally as devastating including high blood pressure, decreased fertility, nerve disorders and kidney damage.

				<div id="leadText" class="textDisplay">
					<h4> X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) Analysis</h4>
					<p>
						Public Health Officials, Environmental professionals and community activists face an overwhelming challenge: pinpoint leads location in the environment, identify the source of contamination and confirm that the clearance criteria have been achieved after abatement. The traditional approach has been built on field based sampling combined with laboratory analysis of paint chips and dust. This method is destructive, time consuming, limited in scope and expensive. This has been largely replaced by the use of handheld analyzers that effectively bring the laboratory to the field. Our XRF analyzers quickly locate and quantify the presence of lead in virtually all sample times –paint, consumer goods, soil and dust. Supported by Performance Characteristic Sheet (PCS) Documenting no inconclusive reading, no false positive/negative readings , our XRF Analyzer can determine in seconds whether lead is positive or negative according as defined by the US EPA Standards of greater than 1.0 mg/cm2 .  In addition the results can tell you whether the lead is present on the surface or whether deeply buried within the paint matrix. XRF testing leaved no marks on tested areas saving you time and money by avoiding follow up repairs. Results are immediate followed by same or next day reports that can be used in violation removal for NYC DOH and HPD Violations for possible lead based paint or as evidence in legal situations.
					</p>
					<h4>Paint Chip Analysis</h4>
					<p>
						In areas where XRF Analysis cannot be used such as pop corn ceilings or other uneven surfaces, paint chip analysis is made whereby 2 inch square paint samples are removed and analyzed by an NLLP accredited laboratory.  Written reports with the findings are issued by these accredited laboratories.
					</p>
					<h4>Dust Wipe Clearance</h4>
					<p>
						At the completion of a lead abatement project, a qualified technician is required to perform the final clearance testing in order to insure that hazardous lead based paint dust has been removed from the residence. The clearance sample may include dust swipe sampling, soil sampling and air sampling. A visual examination and collection of environmental samples to be analyzed by an accredited laboratory upon completion of abatement project. XRF Testing is available as well at or near completion of an abatement project to insure that the contractor has met all the requirements of abatement before he leaves the site. Satisfactory clearance dust wipe sampling reports are required to remove any lead based paint violations issued by the NYC DOH and HPD where abatement is required.
